    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of bread (white or whole wheat)</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (Cheddar, American, or your choice)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Skillet: Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Butter the Bread: Spread butter evenly on one side of each bread slice. The buttered side will be the outer part of the sandwich to get that golden, crispy texture.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Sandwich: Place two slices of bread, buttered side down, on the skillet. Add two slices of cheese on each, then top with the remaining bread slices, buttered side up.</li>
        <li>Grill the Sandwich: Cook for about 3-4 minutes on the first side until the bread is golden brown. Carefully flip the sandwich over and press down slightly with a spatula. Cook for another 3-4 minutes until the second side is golden brown and the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Serve Immediately: Remove from the skillet, slice in half if desired, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
