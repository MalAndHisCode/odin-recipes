    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make the Meat Sauce</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the ground meat to the skillet. Cook, breaking it apart with a spoon, until browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Add water or red wine if using. Bring to a simmer and let cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Filling</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Layer lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top. Cover the top with the remaining mozzarella and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake the Lasagna</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna stand for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
