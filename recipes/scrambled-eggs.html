    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk or water</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the Eggs: In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk (or water), salt, and pepper until well combined. The addition of milk or water helps make the eggs softer and fluffier.</li>
        <li>Heat the Pan: Melt the butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. It's important to use low heat to avoid overcooking the eggs.</li>
        <li>Cook the Eggs: Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it sit, without stirring, for a few seconds until it begins to set around the edges. Using a spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges toward the center. Continue this process, moving the eggs around the pan until they're softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat as the eggs will continue to cook from the residual heat of the pan.</li>
        <li>Serve Immediately: Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate. They're best enjoyed warm and can be garnished with fresh herbs, cheese, or a side of toast.</li>
    </ol>
